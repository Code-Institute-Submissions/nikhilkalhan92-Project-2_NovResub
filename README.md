 ### INITIAL DESIGN ###

 My initial idea was to create a fun interactive game based on a show I used to watch.

- The site needs to be easy to use
- Moving the mouse around the site needs to be simple
- Images that show what the bar looks like inside and the layout 

#### First Time Visitors ####
- The browser must find the game easy to use and play.
- I want the browser to understand how to play the game and the rules





#### LANGUAGES USED ####

 
- HTML 
- CSS  
- JavaScript 

### PROGRAMS USED ###
Font Awesome:
Font Awesome was using for a few icons used in the footer aspect of the site pages.

Google Fonts:
Google Fonts was used for all the text content on the site pages.

GitPod:
GitPod was used to write up the code for my project and using the GitPod terminal to commit everything to GitHub.

GitHub:
GitHub is being used to store all the code for this project after being pushed from GitPod.

Balsamiq:

2. Create a new repository named "MS2-Project"
3. Once created, click on "Settings" on the navigation bar under the repository title.
4. Choose which folder to deploy from, I used "/root".
5. Click "Save", then wait for it to be deployed. 
6. The URL will be displayed above the "source" section in GitHub Pages.
