Welcome to my second project. This project is a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game involving the programming languages HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. This game will demonstrate basic JavaScript functionality.


[Here is a link to the final project](https://nikhilkalhan92.github.io/Project-2/)

### AM I RESPONSIVE ###

### 1. UX

Everybody knows the basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but not everyone knows about the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game which originated from the TV show, Big Bang Theory ( Season 2 Episode 8 - "The Lizard-Spock Expansion" ). This game adds 2 extra weapons, Lizard and Spock. This changes the dynamic of the game giving the player/s more variety to win.

## 2. Strategy

### Project Goals

The main goal of this game is to create a fun entertaining game that is interactive to the user and to display the basic use of JavaScript functions. I want the player to be engaged with the game.

 ### User Goals:

First Time Visitor Goals
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to be engaged with the concept of the game.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to easily understand the rules of the game.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to play the game to win.

Returning Visitor Goals
-   As a Returning Visitor, I want to beat the computer.

Frequent User Goals
-   As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if we have adjusted the game emojis.

### User Expectations:

The game should be engaging and display a winner and loser.

-   The weapon selection is clear.
-   The user interface is easy to navigate.
-   The game is responsive on all devices including mobile, tablet and desktop.
-   To have the ability to contact the creator of the game.

### Trends of modern games:

-   Mobile gaming 


### 2. - Structure

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

-   Responsive on all device sizes
-   Easy navigation through labelled buttons
-   Footer at the bottom of the index page that links to the social media website.
-   All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.

### FINAL DESIGN ###

## DESIGN
COLOR SCHEME
My overall color scheme used throughout the site.

- Crimson Red - 
- Dodger Blue
- Green
- Royal Blue
- Hex 

### WIREFRAME ###

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create my wireframes as this gives the template of the UI. This also shows where all elements will be placed within the screen.

There are 3 versions of each wireframe as one shows the design on a web browser and the other shows a Ipad and Iphone

### 3. Features

### Landing Page

- Rules button - This button opens up a popup modal. This modal explains all the rules for the game. Listing the winning possibilities of each weapon. 

- Start game button - This button will allow the user to navigate to the game page.

- Footer - The footer is placed at the bottom of this page. This contains all social media links that open up in a new tab. When hovering over each icon, the icon magnifies.

### Game Page

-   Results - The results section of the page shows the user the outcome of the round.

-   Scoreboard - The scoreboard shows the current score between user and computer. I have color coded the player and computer. So the player will be red, and the computer blue. Once, you start playing, the player presses the emoji they select. Once that happens, the computer option will come up in blue, and the score updates depending on if you win/lose. A sentence will appear telling you the results with the emojis.

-   Select your option - This section allows the player to select their desired weapon. There are 5 icons rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock. When hovering over each weapon the icon background changes colour to give the user confirmation before selecting the weapon. 

-   Player/Computer choices - This section shows the selection of weapons made by the player and the generated weapon selection for the computer. This uses the same icons as the initial weapon selection part.

-   X option- This button will take the user back to the index page.

- Index Page - if you click out, you will get another pop up modal of start new game or continue the one you are in.

- The game will end and take you to the homepage, showing who won once a player reaches the 2 score.
