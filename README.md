### AM I RESPONSIVE ###

### 1. UX

Everybody knows the basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but not everyone knows about the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game which originated from the TV show, Big Bang Theory ( Season 2 Episode 8 - "The Lizard-Spock Expansion" ). This game adds 2 extra weapons, Lizard and Spock. This changes the who dynamic of the game giving the player/s more variety to win.

## 2. Strategy

### Project Goals

The main goal of this game is to create a fun entertaining game that is interactive to the user and to display the basic use of JavaScript functions. I want the player to be engaged with the game.

 ### User Goals:

First Time Visitor Goals
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to be engaged with the concept of the game.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to easily understand the rules of the game.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to play the game to win.

Returning Visitor Goals
-   As a Returning Visitor, I want to beat the computer.
-   As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organization with any questions I may have.

Frequent User Goals
-   As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly animations to the weapons.

### User Expectations:

The game should be engaging and display a winner and loser.

-   The weapon selection is clear.
-   The user interface is easy to navigate.
-   The game is responsive on all devices including mobile, tablet and desktop.
-   To have the ability to contact the creator of the game.

### Trends of modern games:

-   Mobile gaming 
-   Virtual reality

### 2. - Structure

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

-   Responsive on all device sizes
-   Easy navigation through labelled buttons
-   Footer at the bottom of the index page that links to the social media website.
-   All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.

### FINAL DESIGN ###

DESIGN
COLOR SCHEME
My overall color scheme used throughout the site.

- Crimson Red - 
- Dodger Blue
- Green
- Royal Blue
- Hex 

### WIREFRAME ###

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create my wireframes as this gives the template of the UI. This also shows where all elements will be placed within the screen.

There are 4 versions of each wireframe as one shows the design on a web browser and the other shows a Ipad, Iphone and mobile browser format.
