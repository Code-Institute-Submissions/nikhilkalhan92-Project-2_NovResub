Welcome to my second project. This project is a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game that involves languages like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. This game will demonstrate basic JavaScript functionality.

 ### INITIAL DESIGN ###

 My initial idea was to create a fun interactive game based on a show I used to watch.

- The site needs to be easy to use
- Moving the mouse around the site needs to be simple
- Images that show what the bar looks like inside and the layout 

#### First Time Visitors ####
- The browser must find the game easy to use and play.
- I want the browser to understand how to play the game and the rules
